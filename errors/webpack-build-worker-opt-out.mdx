## Webpack Build Worker Opt-out

#### Why This Error Occurred

The Next.js config contains custom webpack configuration, as a result, the webpack build worker optimization was disabled.

The webpack build worker optimization helps alleviate memory stress during builds and reduce out-of-memory errors although some custom configurations may not be compatible.

#### Possible Ways to Fix It

Upgrade Next.js to latest (>= 14.1.0) to remove this warning.

```
npm i next@latest
```
